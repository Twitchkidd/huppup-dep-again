## Setup

First thing is there's some error with the webpack build that's solved with: `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`

Except VS Code doesn't start when that's set, so ... okay, I don't know about build/serve/etc, for the moment it's in the npm script, start the project with `yarn dev`
